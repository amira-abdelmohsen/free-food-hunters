        <p class="text-muted">
          Millions of pounds of food are wasted every year on college campuses. Meanwhile, students often skip meals due to cost or access. Free Food Finder bridges this gap by helping ensure no good food goes to waste.

        <p class="text-muted">
          Since our launch, we've helped dozens of student organizations share leftover food with hundreds of students. It's more than food — it's about building community and sustainability.
